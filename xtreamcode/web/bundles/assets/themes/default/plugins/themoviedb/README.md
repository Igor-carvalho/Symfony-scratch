The Movie DB (javascript library)
=================================

![TMDB Javascript](http://codenatic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tmdb.jpg "Good movie!")

A Javascript library to interact with the RESTful API of [themoviedb.org](http://www.themoviedb.org/ "The Movie DB").

You will need an **api_key** to use the API, please get one at [themoviedb.org](http://www.themoviedb.org/ "The Movie DB").

Usage
=====

Please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/cavestri/themoviedb-javascript-library/wiki "See the wiki!") for usage examples and descriptions, i haven't added any comment to the library to make it smaller. (You can download the minified version too)

Methods supported
=============

Currently the library supports all the methods of the API, anyway if you note that the API was updated and not the library or you see some kind of error, please add an [issue](https://github.com/cavestri/themoviedb-javascript-library/issues "Add a bug") and i will fix it as soon as possible.
